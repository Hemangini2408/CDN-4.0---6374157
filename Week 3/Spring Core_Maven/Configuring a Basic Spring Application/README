# 📚 LibraryManagement Spring Application

This is a basic **Spring Framework** project configured using **XML-based configuration**. It demonstrates how to create and wire service and repository beans using Spring's IoC container.

---

## 🧩 Features

- Java-based classes for `BookService` and `BookRepository`
- Spring XML configuration (`applicationContext.xml`)
- Demonstrates dependency injection using `<bean>` and `<property>`
- Simple Maven project structure
- Runs with a single main method (`MainApp.java`)
